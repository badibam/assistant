**Version 0.3.8**

**Fixes & Improvements**

* **ZoneScreen**

  * Fixed tool instance mapping errors caused by missing `include_config` parameter.
  * Added consistent retrieval of `config_json`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` in all list calls.

* **AI Providers**

  * Fixed incomplete OpenAI responses caused by `max_output_tokens` limits.
  * Increased token limits for OpenAI and Claude (max 32 000, default 8 000).
  * Unified token configuration and ensured correct persistence in UI and schema.

* **Automations**

  * Fixed provider selection bug: automations now correctly use their configured provider instead of the active chat provider.
  * Improved provider resolution logic in `AIEventProcessor` and `AIClient`.

* **Database Migration (v12 → v13)**

* **Transcribed Data**

 * Removed redundant `segments_texts` from transcription metadata to reduce data size.

* **UI and Interaction Enhancements**

 * Click-to-copy in AI messages (`ChatComponents.kt`)
 * Enrichments in RichComposer – edit/delete buttons always visible
 * Empty user messages are not stored but still trigger AI call
 * Keyboard closes after sending a message
 * Module communication – display of the question along with the answer
 * Editing and deletion of automations in automation config screen
